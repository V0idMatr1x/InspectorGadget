# InspectorGadget

A system specification inspection tool for the Windows terminal written C++!

You can think of it as a more minimal and faster Neofetch for Windows or a more minimal Winfetch alternative with some retro vibes!

This project is the spiritual successor to [SimpleFetch](https://github.com/V0idMatr1x/SimpleFetch) which is less featureful and written in Python; Python has obvious limitations for this use case.
